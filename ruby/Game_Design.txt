My class would initialize a variable that would match the word of the first user. Then after the word is processed
The second player would guess a letter per turn. the guess would parse through the array and see if the letter matched
one of the letters in the array. if the guess was correct, a message would be displayed congratulating the player and the status of that word would be posted. I'm not yet sure to the extent of how much I should punish errors. maybe 4 mistakes and the other player wins, but ocourse if i do that there needs to be a word length limit. false guesses would also need to return a message with an incorrect statement and the status of the word as well.
