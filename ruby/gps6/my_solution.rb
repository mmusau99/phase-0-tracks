# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge with Mumo Musau.
# We spent 1 hour on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require_relative allows you to access another file by providing its relative path (rather than a full filepath).
# since my_solution.rb and state_data.rb are in the same folder, we can use require_relative and the file name to link the two.
