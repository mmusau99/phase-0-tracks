# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?


Version control is a method of maintaining organization during the software engineering 
workflow. It is useful because it allows engineers to simultaneously work on a project.      

A branch is an instance of the original code base. You would use it when you want to change or add code. 

A commit includes your changes of the current branch to the repository. A good commit message is specific and understandable. 

A merge conflict is when two code sets are trying to merge different data into the place on the master. Solve by finding the conflict, marking it and designing a strategy to proceed.
