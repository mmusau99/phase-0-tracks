# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.
* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
`version control is the task of keeping software systems consistent of several version of a single workflow. It's useful because when errors occur in a persons code, it doesn't affect the entire project. It also holds value, because real world disastors of someone's machine won't jepordize one's ability to recreate previous work. Version control helps software developers simultaneously work on projects without getting each others way too.
`
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
`A branch is a copy of the master file. You use branches to segment tasks for a project. This methodology of working allows developers to fix errors on a branch, and then merge those changes to the master copy clear of bugs. 
`
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
`A commit is a command that tells git to save the changes that have occured within an added git file. A good commit is one that utilizes a meaningful message, so that you and fellow devlopers can readily asses the changes from a single glance.
`
* What is a merge conflict?
`A merge conflict is when commits in your current branch are not in other branches nad vice versa. Simply put, commits on branches have diverged.
