# The Linux Philosophy
* Linux never assumes the user is incompetent. Within that statement lies the overarching philosphy of Linux. it assumes you know what you're doing and won't stop you from accomplishing your task. Linux operatess on a egalitarian basis. allowing for the user to create, or cause havoc. Other oeprating systems allow interaction utilizing a graphical interface to dissuade the user from actions the developers deemed outside thier bounds. 

* The linux philosophy is demonstrated by the ease with which one can operate a terminal emulator to access CLI. There are also multiple virtual terminals. 

* Complete Control has to be reiterated once again. there aren't any prompts for any commands executed. 

* Nine major Linux tenets
`1. Small is Beautiful, 2.Each Program Does One Thing Well, 3. Prototype as Soon as Possible, 4.Choose Portability Over Efficiency, 5.Store Data in Flat Text Files, 6.Use Software Leverage, 7.Use Shell Scripts to Increase Leverage and Portability, 8.Avoid Captive User Interfaces, 9.Make Every Program a Filter

* What is a Virtutal Private Sever ?
` a virtual private server is a block of memory that runs on its own operating system. it is like a computer without the hardware. some database hosts the memory, and allows the user to access it remotely. The benefits of using a VPS is its hosted remotely from away from your computer. so if you're interested in testing a variety of different commands, a mistake can be easily rectified. It is also beneficial that important information isn't avaiable on it, so a data breach for monetary purposes is a situation you don't have to worry about. Since the service is private and not shared among other users, a crash of a persons server shared in tandem with yours won't hurt your sites performance. There's also more control, because you have root access you can install custom software to utilize. instead of waiting for your provider to support said software. Scalability is another benefit of a virtual private server. If traffic to your site changes in the future you can update ram usage within minutes, while dedicated hosting services would require you to phsically install ram into your server, which would add downtime as a consequence.

* Reasons not to run applications on Root
`There is potential to harm the core of your operating system utilizing the root user with full power and control of your system. a bug can wipeout critical information within your system if you're logged in to the root user. Also if there's a vlnerability with one of your applications, that application has full privillages and has access to your entire system. viruses will have total power to eliminate anything.
