* #1. I plan on first creating a repl file with jquery syntax.


* #2. I'll then search for documentation pages online.

* #3. I'll try similiar operations I've done in ruby with jquery syntax on a cloud platform.

* #4. I'll watch youtube videos about jquery.

* #4. I'll then design a minigame to test my mastery of said language. 

* #5. If I run into specific problems I'll search for desired solutions.

* I found using a mixture of strategies worked for me. I first watched a beginner tutorial on jquery. I then had to figure out how to initialize jquery within my file, so i took that time to look up documentation on W3schools. Then i created a test index file and start playing around with jquery methods and functions..
