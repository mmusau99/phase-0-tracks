#1. I plan on first creating a repl file with jquery syntax.


#2. I'll then search for documentation pages online.

#3. I'll try similiar operations I've done in ruby with jquery syntax on a cloud platform.

#4. I'll watch youtube videos about jquery.

#4. I'll then design a minigame to test my mastery of said language. 

#5. If I run into specific problems I'll search for desired solutions.
