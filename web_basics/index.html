<h1>
Helmut Lang X Travi$ Scott
</h1>
<p>
I found the <em>Helmut Lang X Travis Scott</em> collaboration to be aesthetically pleasing, but lacking as a collection . It's too simple for the price they're asking for. When I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars on pieces, I expect the items to be of <strong>uncomprable quality,</strong> however the collection is lackluster. I did enjoy the cowboy prints and intensity of the orange bomber, but price is an indicator of quality. The collection needs to not be average, but transcend the occasion. It felt like a money grab similiar to the life of Pablo tour's merch.
